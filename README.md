## Introduction
This dashboard allowes users to view the different areas of human trafficking with a focus on wehre people are being trafficked to and what they are being trafficked for. This dashboard allowes users to change the country of citizenship to then see the coordinating countries they are being taken to. The map tab has an extra filter that allowes the user to see the change of the years. 
The types of trafficking include:
- Unknown (Multiple reasons for this being the case such as the person still not found)
- Forced labour
- Sexual Exploit
- Other Exploit

Human trafficking is an increasing problem in the world and many false claims about where it is actually occuring and for what reasons.  

## Data Source
This data is found in the following website:
- https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/
- https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/blob/master/all/all.csv

## Data Preparation 
- Country name and code conversions
- NA columns categorized as unknown or other

## Use Case
This dashboard can be used by law enforcement and other government bodies to see trends in where people are getting taken to and what they are being taken for. This helps the government better protect certain populations and prepare as necessary to minimize the impact of it.
The dashbaord can als be used by those curious and wanting to push for change. 

## Future Work
In the future I want to make a model that can accurately predict where a person ended up based on characteristics of the person, country of origin, and trafficking reason. I also would like to add more filters to the map in specific to allowe the person to focus on certain explouts rather then all.
